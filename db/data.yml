    - 'Legally Blonde The Musical: The Original Broadway Cast'
    - lb_broadway.jpg
    - Like Wicked, this show is a girl-friendly extravaganza; the main difference--and
      it's a big one--is that the score of Legally Blonde is better. Based on the
      hit Reese Witherspoon movie, the zippy, frothy show tells the story of SoCal,
      pink-loving sorority girl Elle Woods, who enrolls at Harvard Law and goes on
      to prove that appearances can be deceiving. The opening number, "Omigod You
      Guys," gives an idea of what the Broadway-pop score by Laurence O'Keefe (Bat
      Boy--The Musical) and Nell Benjamin is up to, embracing its over-the-top cheer
      with goofily infectious energy. Sure, a couple of numbers feel a bit derivative
      (the show with the witches has "Popular," this one has "Positive"), and the
      Celtic detour ("Ireland") is rather puzzling, but overall the songs are firing
      on all cylinders. Just check out the use of a marching band on "What You Want"
      for instance. Laura Bell Bundy (Amber von Tussle in Hairspray) is a charming
      Elle, and she delivers numbers such as "So Much Better" with the requisite elan.
      But this is not a one-woman show, and Bundy is surrounded by a crack team, including
      the endearing Christian Borle as Elle's love interest Emmett, power-piped Orfeh
      as hairdresser Paulette and up-and-comer Leslie Kritzer as Delta Nu's Serena.

    - Martin Guerre
    - mg.jpg
    - "Martin Guerre is a two-act musical with a book by Claude-Michel Schönberg and
      Alain Boublil, lyrics by Alain Boublil, Edward Hardy and Stephen Clark, and
      music by Claude-Michel Schönberg.\r\n\r\nWritten in the operatic style similar
      to the creative team's previous efforts, Les Misérables and Miss Saigon, the
      bulk of the show is sung-through, with little spoken dialogue between the musical
      numbers.  It failed to match the box office success of its two predecessors."

    - Miss Saigon
    - misssaigon.jpg
    - Miss Saigon is a musical by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, with
      lyrics by Boublil and Richard Maltby, Jr. It is based on Giacomo Puccini's opera
      Madame Butterfly, and similarly tells the tragic tale of a doomed romance involving
      an Asian woman abandoned by her American lover. The setting of the plot is relocated
      to the 1970s Saigon during the Vietnam War, and Madame Butterfly's story of
      marriage between an American lieutenant and geisha is replaced by a romance
      between an American GI and a Vietnamese bargirl.

    - The Pirate Queen
    - piratequeen.jpg
    - "The Pirate Queen is a musical written by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain
      Boublil. John Dempsey is the co-lyricist. The Pirate Queen marks the first time
      Boublil and Schönberg have created a musical with American collaborators. It
      is based on the life and adventures of the 16th century Irish chieftain and
      pirate Gráinne O'Malley, who was one of the last Irish clan leaders to resist
      the English conquest of Gaelic Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter a Chicago production, the
      musical ran on Broadway from March to June 2007. The cast featured Stephanie
      J. Block as Grace O'Malley, Hadley Fraser as Tiernan and Linda Balgord, who
      was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for her performance as Queen Elizabeth
      I. The show received harsh appraisals from the critics and had weak sales."

    - Phantom of the Opera
    - poto.jpg
    - "The Phantom of the Opera is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and
      lyrics by Charles Hart with additions from Richard Stilgoe. Lloyd Webber and
      Stilgoe also wrote the musical's book together.[1] Based on the French novel
      Le Fantôme de l'Opéra by Gaston Leroux, its central plot revolves around a beautiful
      soprano, Christine Daaé, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured
      musical genius.\r\n\r\nThe musical opened in London's West End in 1986, and
      on Broadway in 1988. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for
      Best Musical, and Michael Crawford (in the title role) won the Olivier and Tony
      Awards for Best Actor in a Musical.[2] It is the longest running show in Broadway
      history by a wide margin, and celebrated its 10,000th Broadway performance on
      11 February 2012, the first production ever to do so.[3] It is the second longest-running
      West End musical, after Les Misérables, and the third longest-running West End
      show overall, after The Mousetrap.[4][5][6]\r\n\r\nWith total estimated worldwide
      gross receipts of over $5.6 billion (the highest in history) and total Broadway
      gross of US$845 million (surpassed only by The Lion King),[7] Phantom is the
      most financially successful entertainment event to date.[8][9] By 2011 it had
      been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities in 27 countries, and continues
      to play in both London and New York.[8]"

    - 'Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz'
    - wicked.jpg
    - 'Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is a musical with music and lyrics
      by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It is based on the 1995 Gregory
      Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, an
      alternative telling of the witches from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and L.
      Frank Baum''s classic 1900 story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical is
      told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins
      before and continues after Dorothy''s arrival in Oz from Kansas and includes
      several references to the 1939 film and Baum''s novel. Wicked tells the story
      of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda the
      Good, who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over
      the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard''s corrupt government, and,
      ultimately, Elphaba''s public fall from grace.'
